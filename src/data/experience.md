## Experience

Started out in 2008 as a Flash developer, developing rich interactive campaigns for large international brands. When the iPad hit the market, I transitioned into the promised land of front-end development.

Since the transition I've worked mostly in large long term projects within the public sector with a focus on usability and accessibility.
